## Class Times

**8:45am - 9:50am. Tuesday and Thursday** on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a9e00c29c80774584bfd7136a652bb830%40thread.tacv2/Class%2520Meetings%2520%28Tue%2520and%2520Thu%2520%2540%25208%253B45%2520to%25209%253B50am%29?groupId=eb132915-269f-4304-ad54-5938ab0608a5&tenantId=244e6ed2-339a-47f3-b95c-e45351c198b7)

Our class time is officially scheduled to be 8:30am to 9:50am Tuesday's and Thursday's throughout the semester, but since a big portion of the class is flexible due to being pre-recorded, we start a little later at 8:45am, and we may not always use the entire time.

### Recording of Class Time

Tests and quizzes will not be recorded. Class times involving examples or question periods will be recorded for sharing later on Teams. Please note that if you have an important concern with being recorded than you will want to avoid participating in these parts based on your comfort level (e.g., attendance but not sharing video).

## Pre-Recorded Lectures

Pre-recorded lectures and examples will be the main way that course content is delivered. These will be made available through links on Teams. There may be 3-5 pre-recorded lectures for each week, of 10-30 minutes in length that students should view.

On Teams a channel will be provided for each week of the course. For example, [Week 2](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aeab0b8e591da4608990558b1282614f3%40thread.tacv2/Week%25202%2520-%2520Sept%252014-18?groupId=eb132915-269f-4304-ad54-5938ab0608a5&tenantId=244e6ed2-339a-47f3-b95c-e45351c198b7). This will provide links to activities and content that should be reviewed during that week of the course, and that should be completed before the next week (i.e., lectures and content provided for Week 2 should be completed before the beginning of Week 3).

## Course Work Details

Below is an overview of course work.  

### Course Work and Marking Scheme (Tentative)

The grading scheme and number of items in the grade (in parentheses) is tentative and subject to small adjustments. See syllabus for details on missed or late work for assessment.

- Individual Assignments (5): 40%
- Mini-Project (1): 10%
- Weekly Quizzes/Challenges (During class times) (~8-10): 20%
- Tests (During class times) (2): 20%
- Check-in/one-on-one evaluation: 10%

### Assignments

Assignments are larger and somewhat more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. These are scheduled to be completed once every two weeks throughout the semester.

Assignments should be completed using the course software (Java 8, IntelliJ, Git) see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Mini-Project

The mini-project will be announced in November and is meant to be a somewhat self-directed project. Criteria for assessment and example project ideas will be given. Note that the grades associated with the mini-project are relatively small, so students should keep their expectations in line with the provided criteria and example projects.

The mini-project may be completed individually or in groups of two or three. Additional criteria or requirements will be provided for groups. Students will be responsible for findings their own partners (a channel will be setup on Teams to assist).

### Weekly Quizzes or Coding Challenges

Once every week or two during the scheduled class time an unannounced quiz or challenge will be given. These will be designed to require no more than 30 minutes and evaluate a concept that was presented in lectures or during time.

Coding challenges will be small exercises asking you to fix or practice some practical programming concept. Coding challenges will use Git, in the same way as assignments.

Quizzes will be composed of multiple choice-style questions.

In both cases, you will be asked to stay on the class call on Teams while completing the activity. This way I can answer questions and provide clarifications without any problem.

### Tests

Tests will be longer than quizzes and are designed to test your understanding of the course  content to that period. They will be designed to fit within 50 minutes, but on the days of tests we will plan on starting at 8:30am to ensure everyone has enough time to finish comfortably.

Like quizzes and challenges, you will be asked to stay on the class call on Teams while completing it. This way I can answer questions and provide clarifications without any problem.

### Check-in One-on-One Evaluations

One-on-Ones serve two purposes: they are an opportunity to two a face-to-face evaluation of your progress, a chance for you and your instructor to put a face to a name, and a chance for you to share any concerns "in person". Due to the number of students in the class, these one-on-one's unfortunately will be kept under 10 minutes in length.

In the 2 weeks before the published end dates for One-on-one Evaluations (see Dates below), you will schedule a meeting time using a sign-up app. Your instructor or TA will then call you on Teams at the time of your interview. Check-ins involve a super quick oral test, where you explain some (relatively) simple concept from class, so some revision is recommended before they happen. You should also plan what you might like to share before the meeting (i.e., questions, concerns, requests or recommendations). Any feedback will be shared after the one-on-one has been completed.

It will be the job of the students to schedule their one-on-ones once they have been announced, and the instructor or TA will not follow up with you, if you have not scheduled these.

You are also asked to share your video if you are able and feel comfortable for these meetings to allow the TA and instructor to better connect with you.

## Dates for Deliverables

**NOTE: All dates are tentative and are used as general targets.** Adjustments to dates will be made as needed and will give you additional time and to avoid major conflicts. Adjustments to these dates will be announced in lectures and on Teams.
