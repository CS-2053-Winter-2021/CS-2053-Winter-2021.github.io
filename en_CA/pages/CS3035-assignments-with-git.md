# Using Git for Example Code and Assignments

We will be using Git and GitHub for completing assignments, doing your course project and doing the lab exams. Git is a very powerful tool, but the way we will use it for the course will be quite simple. In all cases, repositories will be created for you and you will "clone" the repositories to get started.

Before you get started with the details in this page you should complete the steps in [Software Setup and Requirements page](pages/cs2053-requirements-and-setup.md).

## Create and Register a GitHub Account
You will need a GitHub Account. Please see these instructions: [To create and register your GitHub account](https://cs-2053-winter-2021.github.io/en_CA/#!pages/cs2053-requirements-and-setup.md)

When using Git we ask that you follow these instructions below carefully, and only stray from them if you know what you are doing. 

There are lots of great git learning resources online like the free [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), if you would like to know more about the course.



## Assignments

Assignments will be hosted and submitted on GitHub. You will need to follow the links below. For convenience we have also set up an example that will be your first Challenge exercise for class.

***Assignment instructions*** will always be found in the assignment repository's readme.md file.

- For assignments you will be provided a repository invitation link.
- You will follow the link, login to GitHub (if not already logged in) and accept the invitation.
- This will create a new repository for you.
- A link will be provided for a repository that has been automatically created on your account
- Follow the link to view your Repo
- In IntelliJ Start a "New Project from Version Control"
- Choose GitHub and make sure you are logged in
- You should be able to select your repo for the assignment from your list or search for it
- Select the repo and click Clone
- Once you have completed your changes. You need to commit all of them.
- To ***commit***:
  - Right click on the top level directory of your project in your "Project" sidebar
  - Click Git -> Commit Directory...
  - Type in a descriptive commit message outlining your changes and click "commit"
- Finally you can ***push*** your commits to GitHub to submit your challenge/assignment
  - Click the "Green arrow" on the toolbar
  - or, ```ctrl + shift + k``` on Windows
  - or, ```VCS -> Git -> Push```
  - Click "Push"
- Finally, visit your repo on GitHub to make sure your changes have been pushed.

## Challenge 1 - Practicing Submitting Assignments

Your first weekly challenge is to get practice with starting an assignment on GitHub and submitting your changes to the repo on GitHub to submit your Challenge assignment.

**This challenge is due on Tuesday, September 15 at 4pm.**

- Review the instructions for [setting up your development software](CS3035-software-setup.md) and the instructions above for submitting assignments.
- Accept the Challenge invitation using this link: [Invitation to Challenge 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/kCfudltV)
- From IntelliJ create a "New Project from Version Control" using GitHub
- Search and/or Select Challenge-1-Your_GitHub_Username from the list of repositories
- Select your repo from the list and click Clone
- Find and edit your readme.md file
- Follow the steps above for ***committing*** your changes and ***pushing*** them to GitHub
- Verify that your updated readme.md file has been updated on GitHub
